"""Morev (Cyrillic) scheme mapping + factory registration.

Implements the Cyrillic transcription of Thai used by L. N. Morev,
Yu. Ya. Plam, and M. F. Fomicheva in the 1964 Thai-Russian dictionary
and adopted in Russian-language Thai-teaching materials. Surface
conventions follow the alphabet table at the head of that dictionary;
the same conventions appear in subsequent Morev-tradition reference
works.

Surface conventions:

- Aspirated stops are spelled as a digraph: /kʰ/ → ``кх``, /tʰ/ → ``тх``,
  /pʰ/ → ``пх``. The HTML overlay raises the second element so the
  digraph reads as plain consonant + superscript х (``к<sup>х</sup>``,
  ``т<sup>х</sup>``, ``п<sup>х</sup>``). The aspirated palatal /tɕʰ/ is
  written as a bare ``ч`` with no aspiration mark in either format —
  this matches the Morev alphabet table, which lists ฉ / ช / ฌ as ``ч``.
- Unaspirated palatal /tɕ/ → ``ть`` (digraph; the alphabet table lists
  จ as тьо̄).
- /h/ → ``х``; /ŋ/ → ``нг``; /ʔ/ has no surface symbol.
- Long vowels carry a combining macron (U+0304) on the first vocalic
  element. Centring diphthongs spell the off-glide as bare ``а`` after
  the macron-bearing nucleus (``ӣа``, ``ы̄а``, ``ӯа``).
- The source dictionary uses Cyrillic ``о̄``/``о`` as the default
  rendering for both modern Thai /oː/ and /ɔː/ in long open syllables.
  The Latin ``ɔ̄``/``ɔ`` glyphs from the introductory transcription key
  appear only sporadically in the dictionary body, without a derivable
  phonological pattern; the renderer therefore emits Cyrillic
  ``о̄``/``о`` for both vowels and treats the Latin glyphs as out of
  scope. Mid-central /ɤ/ uses the schwa ``ə`` (U+0259), which is
  intentionally non-Cyrillic and reproduces the dictionary's
  typesetting.
- ``ว`` in the second slot of a true CC onset cluster (e.g. /kw/, /kʰw/)
  surfaces as the back vowel ``у``: ``กวาง`` → ``куа̄нг``. As a bare
  initial ``ว`` is ``в``; as a coda glide it is ``у``.
- Tones are spacing modifiers placed at the end of the syllable, after
  the coda: LOW ``ˆ`` (U+02C6), FALLING ````` (U+0060), HIGH
  ``ˇ`` (U+02C7), RISING ``´`` (U+00B4); MID is unmarked. The engine's
  tone names follow the modern-phonology convention (HIGH = high pitch,
  RISING = low-to-high contour); these correspond to Morev's
  contour-named "rising-falling" (tone 3) and "rising" (tone 4) marks
  respectively.
- Foreign-origin codas that no native syllable supports collapse to
  the nearest native stop or nasal: /f/ → ``п``, /s/ → ``т``, /l/ → ``н``.
  This matches the dictionary's treatment of recent loans
  (``ก๊าซ`` → ``ка̄тˇ``, ``โบนัส`` → ``бо̄-натˇ``, ``ฟุตบอล`` → ``футˇ-бо̄н``,
  ``ปรู๊ฟ`` → ``прӯпˇ``).
- Syllable separator is ``-``.
